<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a Shiny interface intended to demonstrate how to set up a Shiny app prediction model. The dataset this model is built on is a prospective cohort of UK women with breast cancer. The model predicts the relative risk of coronary artery disease compared to an individual who has mean values for each covariate.
